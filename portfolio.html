            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

            <h3>EDUCATION AND EXPERIENCE</h3>
            <p>Here is some information about my educational background.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class= "important">Bachelor of Laws (LLB (Hons))</span><br>UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM<br>2017-2020</li>
                <li>GCE A-Levels:<br><span class= "important">Chemistry, History, Biology, French (AS)</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p>I have worked for a number of establishments, most significantly:</p>
            <ul>

            <h3>PROGRAMMING</h3>
            <p>I've always been interested in programming, and how programmers are able to code (which looked like Greek to me only a few weeks ago!). While computers are powerful tools, they are really very simple and follow rules stringently and literally, which can make them very frustrating to deal with.<br>I am coming to learn that good programming is really just an effective way to communicate with a computer, and getting it to do what you want it to do. The many programming languages developers use are versatile, and can be stacked on top of each other to craft powerful tools. I joined Moringa to gain an undertsanding of how I can work with computers to create effective tools for myself and others. While the work displayed here is quite basic, I will keep this page updated with more complex projects as and when I learn about them.</p>
